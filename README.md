# week 1 challenge

What was the challenge?

This week’s challenge was to use the Agile methodology and the task given to create EPICS and USER STORIES for the project given.

How I expected the challenge to go?
I originally expected this to be a quick and easy exercise putting into practice what we have learned in the first week.
 I expected to do what I usually do and overthink the task in hand and would try and avoid over complicating things attempting to keep this as quite a straight forward task as I have understood the first week learning when it comes to AGILE. 


What went well?

Being able to create a repo on git and create files.
I was able to work with some of the team to help me understand what to do and get some leeway on the task at hand and so meeting and working with the team was a plus for me


What didn’t go as planned?
I over complicated the task and started to overthink everything from the get go!  Which lead to a lot of time being wasted.
My time management went out the window and ended up working on this task for hours without taking a break?
I couldn’t quite understand at first the breakdown and structure of the user stories.


Possible improvements for future challenges?
I need to try and take breaks. 
I need to try and simplify the user stories and then work on adding the more complicated stuff later on.
